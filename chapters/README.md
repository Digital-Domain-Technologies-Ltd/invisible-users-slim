### About This Book

This book provides practical guidance for making websites readable by AI agents while maintaining excellent user experience for humans. Based on 25 years of web development experience and real client work with companies like Nissan, Ford, and Jaguar Land Rover.

### Quick Start

If you're new to the topic, start with Chapter 1 to understand why AI readability matters, then skip to Chapter 10 for the implementation roadmap.

If you're already convinced and want to start implementing, go straight to Chapters 4-6 for practical patterns.

### Key Takeaways

- **Semantic HTML matters**: Use proper elements (article, nav, section, etc.)
- **Structure reveals intent**: Clear heading hierarchies help AI understand your content
- **Test early, test often**: Use the "morning-after test" with ChatGPT or Claude
- **Progressive enhancement**: Make content work without JavaScript, enhance with it
- **Start small**: Fix high-value pages first, expand gradually

### Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Assessment and prioritization
- **Weeks 2-3**: Quick wins (Schema.org, headings, links)
- **Weeks 4-6**: Structural improvements
- **Weeks 7-8**: Content patterns
- **Week 9**: Testing and validation
- **Week 10+**: Ongoing maintenance

Total initial investment: 85-115 hours over 9 weeks for comprehensive implementation.
